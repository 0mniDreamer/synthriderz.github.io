# synthriderz.github.io

This repo contains the source code for [synthriderz.github.io ](https://synthriderz.github.io ).

## Status

As of march 2025 **the content of this site is a fixed-up restore of the now offline wiki.synthriderz.com** that was restored entirely from https://wayback.archive.org.

The content has been converted to markdown and is rendered using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).  
The content already got updated a bit, to not present super outdated information - but there is still a lot of work to do.

## Indipendency

This repository is not affiliated with the game Synth Riders or Kluge Interactive in any way.

## Goals of this repository

By restoring the content from archive.org and migrating it over into this GitHub repository, it becomes possible to collaborate on the content and keep it up to date.  
Not only makes it easier to update the content by anyone, but it also means that the content can't get lost again.

## Contributing

Please contribute!  
Update the content, fix typos, add new information, etc.  
Since docsify uses plain Markdown, it should be very easy to get started.

The current focus is on getting the content up to date - changes to the theme or structure may follow.
