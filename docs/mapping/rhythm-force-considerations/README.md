# Considerations When Mapping For Rhythm And Force Players

Rhythm is the default, and generally more popular, game mode, but it's up to you whether your map is optimized for Rhythm or Force play (this will depend on which mode you playtest more). Either way, you won't actually need to put much effort into making the map work in both
modes, as most motions will wind up being comfortable in both.

Here are a few guidelines you can follow to make sure your map is fun for both play styles, even if you do minimal (if any) playtesting of the other mode.

When making a Rhythm map, keep the following in mind so that Force players can enjoy the map, too.

## Motion

Force scoring is based on velocity through the note, so sections that do not encourage movement create awkward gameplay for Force players. Try to keep enough motion throughout the map so that Force players don't have to resort to awkward strategies.

- Highly dense note timings usually play well since you can get high scores in a single big motion.
- Sparse timings also play well since you have time to reset and build up momentum.
- In between those two extremes, you'll need to make sure you are creating motions that allow Force players to carry momentum throughout the section. This is typically more fun for Rhythm players too, so it's a win-win situation!

## Two handed specials

It can be difficult to keep your momentum and balance when hitting two handed special patterns in Force. Make sure that two handed specials are a bit more restrained than other notes so as not to mess up a Force player's balance. This applies to Rhythm as well, but the issue is
more pronounced in Force.

> This applies to any two handed pattern where both hands are close together.

## Rhythm Considerations

Keep the following in mind when making a Force map so that it plays well in Rhythm, too.

## Motion

Sections with sparse note timings (such as a note every two downbeats) might play well in Force, but not have enough motion to be fun in Rhythm. Players who optimize their Rhythm score will move as slowly and early as the game allows them to, which reduces the impact of notes.

- Maximizing the movement distance between notes can be the first step to making sparse note sections more fun in Rhythm. This shouldn't affect playability in Force.
- Impact can be restored with arced or curved rails if needed. They force the motion to ramp up suddenly instead of being slow and steady. This will take a bit of freedom away from Force players, but it could be worth doing if the section is too boring in Rhythm.
