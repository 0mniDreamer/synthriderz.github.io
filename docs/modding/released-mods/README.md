## Mods

> Before you can start adding these mods to your game, you have to install MelonLoader first. Check out our guide [here](/installing-custom-content/pcvr/installing-mods/).

If you already have MelonLoader set up, just drag & drop the respectable .dll-file of the mod into your Mods directory.

!> Due to changes to the Game in September 2024, many older mods on GitHub are not working anymore.
